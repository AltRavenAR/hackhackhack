My project is called Office Simulator
Basically, you battle your coworkers and fight your way to the top (by devious means)

I started working on this while at my summer internship (and had some disagreements with a coworker)

I made my project using python.

I learned to be reallly careful with looking over my code. Like really careful. It only takes one word to mess up the whole thing!
